- configure the key identity for signing as a function of the user name

- validate upon signing that the user name/address matches the key

- report upon verification if the signature identity/address/date differs from
  the commit

- output a summary line when verifying multiple signatures

- find a means of signing commits after the fact and recognising such
  signatures upon verification (sign in place, use mercurial's native signing
  mechanism, implement a micro-protocol on top of commitsigs's mechanism, ...)

- add tests
