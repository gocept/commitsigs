- try to integrate better with mercurial's own signing mechanism (for example,
  re-use the sigcheck command)

- find a means of signing commits after the fact and recognising such
  signatures upon verification (sign in place, use mercurial's native signing
  mechanism, implement a micro-protocol on top of commitsigs's mechanism, ...)

- offer a tool to re-validate bad signatures (including old signatures by keys
  now expired); consider a commit signed if it carries at least one good
  signature

- add tests
