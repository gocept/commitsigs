=====================================
Automatic signing of changeset hashes
=====================================

This experimental extension will let you sign the changeset hash when
you commit. The signature is embedded directly in the changeset
itself; there wont be any extra commits.

It currently uses uses GnuPG_ and OpenSSL_, but it should be easy to
extend it to use other programs in the future.

Activate it and see ``hg help commitsigs`` for more information.

Works with Mercurial version 1.3 or later.
