====================================
Automatic signing of manifest hashes
====================================

This experimental extension will let you sign the manifest hash when
you commit. This hash is computed over all files in the repository and
their history, but excludes the changelog meta data. A future version
of the extension will sign the changelog data as well.

It currently uses uses GnuPG_, but it should be easy to extend it to
use other programs in the future.

Activate it and see ``hg help autosign`` for more information.
